"""The tests of the seams for firmwares built on small-beeps (clean-1027;
docs/DESIGN-NOTES.md, "Seams for firmwares built on small-beeps";
docs/BUILDING-ON-SMALL-BEEPS.md), check C-SEAMS.

  seams_suite.py --build DIR --out DIR [--only NAME ...]

DIR is build A's outputs (tools/build.sh build). Each case builds what it
needs with tools/build.sh into OUT/<case>/ and runs it in fwtest
(tools/fwtest, the pinned image) where it runs anything. The cases:

- ownbase (R-BUILD-3): a test build holding a store that writes back
  into the register it stores (SB_TEST_OWNBASE, firmware/src/probe.c)
  is refused, its message naming the object, the function and the
  instruction, and so is the same with PLAITS_HWFLOAT defined (the
  check's one exception is the Plaits demo's hardware-float measurement
  builds, tools/build.sh); build A, which passed the same check, holds
  none.

- outside (R-BUILD-4): the firmware built with an outside source folder
  (tools/build.sh --src tests/seams/outside: C including a base header
  and one of its own, assembly in a folder below, C++, and a file named
  as a base file is): each one's symbols in the ELF, the base's
  same-named file built too; the folder copied to two other places on
  the host and built from each, with the source mounted at another path
  for one (as C-BUILD-B does), gives the same outputs byte for byte;
  --leave-out firmware/src/probe.c builds without it (its object never
  built) and, as it holds nothing without a test define, gives build A's
  image; a folder holding the base, a folder inside firmware/ and a base
  file that isn't one are refused.

Prints what each case saw, and exits 1 if any failed.
